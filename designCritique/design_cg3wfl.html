            This is the portfolio I made created in COGS 187A, but I'll try not to be biased in my critique. Since it is my own portfolio, it is inline with what I want to present to a potential employer. The page is on the simpler side, and I would classify that this falls into the "not enough details" category; it doesn't reveal much about the person on the page. It doesn't look exactly professional since the page looks like it is done by an amateur. The skillset is revealed after scrollign down a the page a little bit and there is also a linked resume. 

            <br><br>

            The design is flat and minimalistic. THe font selection is simple and nothing too complicated. The black and white color is simple and is not very distracting.

            This isn't quite consistent with the image that I want to present to an employer. It might work for the person and the kind of job they're lookign for, but it's just not really my style. I find the style to be a little too playful. The page is not overdone or busy, but also not minimialistic. It is not immediately obvious what the person's skillset is from the brief look of the website site; you'd have to spend time reading into the website to actually see what skill the person is trying to promote.

            <br><br>

            The design is on the flat and (kind of) minimalistic side. The font selection is very playful and shows the person's personality; it complements the design of the website. The color is quite basic and very white and I'm personally not a big fan of it. I perfer dark mode whenever I can, so a white background is like the bane of my existence.

          <div class="container">
            This is not consistent with the image I want to present to an employer; the page is very busy and looks overdone. I think the page could've been better served if the person didn't have a wall of text at the top or if there were fewer images. It doesn't really convey professionalism (but doesn't look unprofessional either) since the person's skillsets aren't exactly "professional." The website reveals the skillset with the very page with several sentencesn describing the skillset of the person. 

            <br><br>

            In terms of simplicity, the page has a relatively flat design, but it is not minimalistic. There aren't really any noticeable added effects. It is definitely not skeuomorphism. The contrast of black and white color work very well as it is easy on the eye of the reader and I think it complement the website.

          <div class="container">
            I really like this website. It does look kind of similar to my portfolio (except on a much much better level). It is consistent with the image with what I have in mind. The page is simple and shows just enough details; it has enough context on the page to give a glimpse into the skillset of the person without being overbearing with too much content. It looks very professionally done. Since this person is a programmer, the portfolio has images and videos relating to computers so it is very obvious that the person is a programmer. 

            <br><br>

            The page is very simple; it has a minimalistic and flat design. Most of the shapes and icons are very bare and do not have unnecessary components. I like the colors; the black, white, and gray serve as good contrast and make the site easy on the eye. I found the font selection to be quite interesting, though; the author chose to mix in serif and sans-serif font together. Usually, people will use either, but not both. Aside from the colors from the images, the overall site doesn't utilize bright colors.

          <div class="container">

            While this isn't the kind of portfolio I would present myself, I actually do like this portfolio. The design is very unique and eye-catching. In a world where most portfolios have multiple pages and long texts, this one only has a single page with the main page listing information of major achievements over the year. 

            <br><br>

            The page is on the simple side; however the style is more reminiscent of skeuomorphism. This is probably as a result of the style of the font used in "who is red?" and the image of the person's face. The font complements the page in my opinion. The color...well there are only 4 main colors on the page: red, orange, white, black. THe page is very easy on the eye. Despite being so minimalistic and not having a lot of information about the person at all on the page, it is very intriguing
