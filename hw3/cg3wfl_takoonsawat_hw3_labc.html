    <dt>how BOOTSTRAP 4.0 framework simplifies styling</dt>
    <dd>
      Bootstrap is a framework that is used for building responsive websites. It
      contains custom-built CSS classes that are readily available to use.
      Instead of having to manually create and style your own CSS classes,
      Bootstrap saves time and headache by allowing you to use pre-made classes
    </dd>

    <dt>steps needed to use BOOTSTRAP 4.0</dt>
    <dd> 
      Download the files <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/">here</a> <br>
      Bootstrap can also be installed using the npm command &quot;npm install bootstrap&quot; <br>
      Link them using the &lt;link&gt; and &lt;script&gt; tags <br>
      Once Bootstrap is loaded, all that's left is to apply the classes to
      elements. For example, add the "table" class to a table tag to utilize the
      custom-built table CSS provided by Bootstrap. 
    </dd>

    <dt>favorite BOOTSTRAP 4.0 feature</dt>
    <dd>
      I like the responsive classes that Bootstrap comes with. It allows the
      website to easily scale on various screen sizes seamlessly. Without this,
      the content will have a pre-set size that will not scale regardless of the
      screen size. If you were to have to manually make the elements responsive, it takes a bit of time and effort to do. Bootstrap's responsive features takes care of this. Additionally, the built in classes are also useful since it allows you to quickly create a good looking website without having to spend a lot of time on it.
